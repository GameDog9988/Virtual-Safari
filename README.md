# Virtual Safari
This project is a recreation of the Pumba and Timone Virtual Safari Jeep Tour, an interactive "choose-your-own-adventure" from the *The Lion King* bonus DVD.

## How it Works
When you press the "Start Journey" button, the first video of the experience will begin. Our hosts on the safari, Pumbaa and Timone, will guide the journey and prompt you, the player, when to make a choice of which direction to take the Jeep. At this time, the video will exit fullscreen and two corresponding buttons will appear that can either be clicked or tapped to play the next video.

All you have to do is to play along and have fun!

## Why did I make this?
Before completing the program, the only "playable" version was people's recordings of the game on YouTube.
I wanted to bring this interactive experience which was near and dear to my heart into an online format where the ability to influence and play the game is possible.
